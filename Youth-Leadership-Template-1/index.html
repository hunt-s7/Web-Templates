            WHAT IS THE ‘THINK OF IT’ – YOUTH LEADERSHIP PROGRAM?
        </div>
        <p class="content-text">
            YLP exists for the youth to act in unison with an aim to create an impact by addressing social, 
            political, and environmental issues. It makes them; the youth realize the significance of a 
            youth-led nation.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
            They need to lead life by their inherent nature; not by the conventional means, which this 
            program supports and remains at disposal for. It’s rather easy to rely upon secondary sources 
            such as newspapers and news channels to keep a tab on everything happening around the globe 
            however gone are the days when these sources were devoid of bias and prejudice. It’s time for 
            the youth to organize themselves amidst this cut-throat quest for truth which is never easy to
             discover let alone expressed in coherent terms. The program blends learning with leadership and 
             fun, aiming at the wholesome development of the most important and energetic cluster of our 
             society – the youth!
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
            To answer the ‘What’ behind this program’s existence would be to usher the youth to, in very 
            straightforward terms, ‘Think of It’ i.e. the ongoing issues pertaining to multifarious spheres, 
            morality, ideals, the sense of justice that prevails and to conjecture upon ideas that should be 
            prevailing instead. Youth and leadership share an intrinsic yet undervalued relationship, we are 
            here to bridge the gap between the two and provide a platform to equip the leaders of tomorrow.

            COURSE OF PROGRAM




        </div>
        <p class="content-text">
            During the course of your involvement in THINK OF IT – Youth Leadership Program, you’ll be 
            involved in various activities related to your city chapters. These activities are not limited 
            to conferences, programs/ discussions on policy making and problem solving which involves working 
            with the local politicians, officials involved and TOI – City Chapter VPs and Managers.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
            Our major emphasis rests on hands-on experience and practical knowledge rather than merely being 
            a platform for dialogue. The time has come to uphold actions over words.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
            We encourage youth to be a part of the summits representing them like The Youth Parliament and 
            The State Conferences hosted bi-annually to bring the leader within them in front of eminent 
            persona’s whose experiences offer a lot to learn about politics, governance and the world.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
            There are city chapters which the youth can partake in after registering and discuss matters 
            related to their cities. The promotions and other managerial positions will be filled on the merit 
            of performance. Hence, your efforts will never be in vain. Your involvement in the decision-making 
            process is our topmost priority because leadership can only be effective when there is equal 
            participation. All in all, we expect you to hone as well as learn leadership skills throughout 
            your journey with us.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
            You have an opportunity to be at the forefront to bring change into the country. You will get 
            to assess problems and carve out unique solutions. Your voice matters to us more than anything 
            else. Experience the cultural and universal diversity through youth forums, city chapters, 
            clusters, state conferences, and national conferences. Lead a team, create your network among 
            local leaders, politicians, personalities known to form a sway/ known to create an impact.

            Poverty, hunger, education problems, unemployment, environmental degradation, ill-treatment of 
            animals and wildlife species, and a long list of ignored critical problems require immediate
             attention. It’s an irony to call ourselves a democracy when people are slowly forgetting its 
             true meaning. It’s preferable to succumb to divisive politics rather than paying heed to issues 
             that make life difficult for the poor and destitute.

        <p class="content-text">
            The Environmental, political, social, and economic crisis is leading us to doomsday. We have still 
            not elevated to the stage of assessing these problems; on how adverse their effects can be. We 
            chose our goals of establishing differences rather than taking the first step and being a helping 
            hand to those around us. Empathy is a long lost value that the youth must work together to 
            re-incorporate into the society.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
            TOI-YLP attempts to mirror every aspect to you: directing and leading you to the root, motivating 
            you to work upon a quick response to urgent problems. Sometimes, it’s impossible to decipher the 
            regulations and bills however as a team, you are capable of unimaginable change. All the issues 
            in our society need ‘Empowered Energetic Enthusiasts’ and the youth can think as well as suggest 
            without preconceived notions. The youth has many opportunities in the world to explore, to drive 
            their life in all modes they wish to, with all terrains of emotions to unearth.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
            Our sole remains to see a nation led by the youth. There is a need to incorporate unique mindsets 
            in all spheres. It’s imperative to have a straightforward group of leaders laying down the terra 
            firma to sustain the future. We hope to invigorate determination in able individuals and provide 
            them with a clear path and vision through our various programs.

             you perused and the ‘Cost’ is your time, will power and the hope to make sure that you are and
              will be heard. Now is the time to give your thoughts the wings they’ve always craved for, the
